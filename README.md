# Eyes on Mouse Exercise

## Description
This demo uses Mouse event data - specifically the X and Y coordinates to reposition the eye balls that are displayed. Because the range of the X and Y coordinates from the mouse are different from the position coordinates for the Eyes; the Mouse Event data has to be converted to a percentage.

## How to Run
The try this demo out, you can click [https://errollgnargnar.github.io/eyesonmouse/](here). It is pretty fun actually! Give it a go!

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
- Create a 3d head that would follow mouse 
- Have the eyes blink
